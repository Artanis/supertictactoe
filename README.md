# Super Tic Tac Toe

Super Tic Tac Toe is a play on the well-known Tic Tac Toe game where instead of
taking squares directly, you win them in games of Tic Tac Toe. However, the game
of Tic Tac Toe you are allowed to play in is determined by the previous player's
move.

## Rules

- There are two players, X and O.
- Player X goes first.
- A player wins when that player has won three games of Tic Tac Toe in a column,
  row, or diagonal.
- The first move of the game can be played in any Tic Tac Toe game.
- Tic Tac Toe games follow normal Tic Tac Toe rules, except they:
  
  1. Don't have a turn order.
  2. Can be played in even after being won (Tic Tac Toe can only be won once).
  
- The game of Tic Tac Toe subsequent turns are played in corresponds to the
  Tic Tac Toe space taken in the previous turn.
    
    For example, if player X takes the center middle space of a Tic Tac Toe in
    the previous turn, player O must play in the center middle Tic Tac Toe.
  
- If the Tic Tac Toe indicated by the previous turn has no open spaces, the next
  player plays in any Tic Tac Toe with open spaces instead.
  
    For example, if the top center Tic Tac Toe game has been filled completely,
    and a player X takes the top middle space in another Tic Tac Toe, player O
    plays in any Tic Tac Toe game.
